# DarsHub - empowers #education4everyone
DarsHub is a learning platform that offers free e-learning courses on various topics and subjects in text/PDF formats. Unlike traditional learning platforms such as Udemy, LinkedIn E-Learning, etc. (video-based learning platforms), DarsHub offers e-learning courses in text/PDF formats to provide education specifically for those who do not have good enough internet bandwidth. 

DarsHub's goal is to provide education for free to every human in this planet, in particular the people who have no educational opportunities.
